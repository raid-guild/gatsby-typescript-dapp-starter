# Gatsby TypeScript Dapp Starter

A starter kit for dapps with all the developer tooling preconfigured (front end only right now).

## üöÄ Getting started

- Clone the repo and install dependencies by running `yarn`
- Start a development server with `yarn develop`
  - _Other scripts like `build`, [`format`](#automatic-code-formatting), [`type-check`](#static-type-checking) and [`lint`](#linting) are also available_
- Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## ‚ú® Developer experience

### üßπ Automatic code formatting

[Prettier][] aims to provide codebase consistency when multiple developers work on the same project. The main reason behind adopting it is to [stop all the on-going debates over coding styles][].

### ‚úÖ Static type checking

[TypeScript][] adds optional types to JavaScript, preventing several programming mistakes. For a quick guide about using React with it, please refer to the [React TypeScript Cheatsheet][].

### üîç Linting

Source code is linted by [ESLint][], enforcing the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide][] through an overridable set of rules provided by [eslint-config-airbnb][].

### üê∂ Git Hooks for Commit and Push

Linting, code formatting, and typechecking are handled automatically using [Husky][] and [lint-staged] every time you make a commit or push to the remote repo.
